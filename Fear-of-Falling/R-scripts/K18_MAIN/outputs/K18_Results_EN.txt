RESULTS: Frailty Change Contrasts Analysis (K18)
================================================

Analysis Overview
-----------------
This analysis examined 12-month changes (Δ) in composite physical function (Z-score) and tested whether these changes differ between frailty groups (ΔΔ frailty) and FOF status (ΔΔ FOF) using mixed models with emmeans contrasts.

Units: All estimates are in standard deviation (SD) units, as Composite_Z is z-scored. Δ represents within-group change; ΔΔ represents between-group differences in change.

Model Structure
---------------
M1 (PRIMARY): time×FOF + time×frailty (NO 3-way interaction)
  → Frailty ΔΔ is COMMON across FOF groups (by design)
  → FOF ΔΔ is COMMON across frailty levels (by design)

M2 (EXPLORATORY): time×FOF×frailty (includes 3-way interaction)
  → Allows stratified contrasts (frailty ΔΔ within FOF; FOF ΔΔ within frailty)
  → Exploratory only; interpret with caution

Model Comparisons (LRT)
-----------------------
M0 vs. M1 (tests time×frailty addition): p < 0.001
  → Significant: Changes differ between frailty groups.

M1 vs. M2 (tests 3-way interaction): p 0.386
  → Not significant: No evidence for 3-way moderation (M1 preferred).

P1: Change Estimates (Δ, 12-month within-cell changes)
------------------------------------------------------
  Robust / nonFOF: Δ = 0.114 (95% CI [-0.204, 0.431], p 0.481)
  Pre-frail / nonFOF: Δ = 0.309 (95% CI [0.166, 0.453], p < 0.001)
  Frail / nonFOF: Δ = -0.139 (95% CI [-0.298, 0.019], p 0.085)
  Robust / FOF: Δ = -0.048 (95% CI [-0.356, 0.261], p 0.761)
  Pre-frail / FOF: Δ = 0.148 (95% CI [0.043, 0.253], p 0.006)
  Frail / FOF: Δ = -0.300 (95% CI [-0.420, -0.181], p < 0.001)

P2: PRIMARY Frailty ΔΔ (COMMON across FOF groups)
--------------------------------------------------
Note: M1 does NOT include 3-way interaction, so frailty contrasts are averaged over FOF.
Adjustment: sidak (emmeans auto-switched from Tukey for interaction contrasts)

  Robust - (Pre-frail): ΔΔ = -0.196 (95% CI [-0.583, 0.192], p 0.535)
  Robust - Frail: ΔΔ = 0.253 (95% CI [-0.142, 0.647], p 0.330)
  (Pre-frail) - Frail: ΔΔ = 0.448 (95% CI [0.269, 0.627], p < 0.001)

P3: PRIMARY FOF ΔΔ (COMMON across frailty levels)
-------------------------------------------------
Note: M1 does NOT include 3-way interaction, so FOF contrast is averaged over frailty.

  FOF ΔΔ (time×FOF interaction): ΔΔ = -0.161 (95% CI [-0.316, -0.007], p 0.041)

P4: Continuous Frailty Proxy (M_cont)
--------------------------------------
Note: Interaction effect from continuous frailty model (time×frailty_score_3).

  time_f12:frailty_score_3: Estimate = -0.286 (95% CI [-0.384, -0.188], p < 0.001)
  Interpretation: Per +1 frailty point, 12-month change differs by -0.286 SD units.

CAUTION: These are exploratory contrasts from M2. Interpret with appropriate skepticism.

  FOF ΔΔ (time×FOF interaction) (in Pre-frail): ΔΔ = -0.087 (95% CI [-0.293, 0.120], p 0.409)

===============================================================================
PRIMARY INTERPRETATION (from M1)
===============================================================================
Changes in physical function over 12 months differ significantly between frailty groups. The 3-way interaction (M2) is not significant (p 0.386), supporting M1 as the preferred model. M1 contrasts are common across groups by design.

All estimates are in SD units (Z-scores), providing standardized effect sizes.
P-values formatted with p_fmt() for consistency.
PRIMARY contrasts use adjustment: sidak
EXPLORATORY contrasts use adjustment: holm
