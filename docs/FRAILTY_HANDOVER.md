# Frailty Integration Handover - Aim 2 Analysis

## 1. Overview
This document summarizes the integration of Frailty Status into the Aim 2 (Health Service Utilization and Costs) panel. The frailty proxy was derived using the Fried-inspired logic from the sibling project `Fear-of-Falling`.

## 2. Data Provenance
- **Source Script**: `Fear-of-Falling/R-scripts/K15_MAIN/K15_MAIN.V1_frailty-proxy.R`
- **Linkage Method**: Linked via `NRO` (Baseline KAAOS ID) and then mapped to `id` (Sotu) for utilization matching.
- **Integration Script**: `Quantify-FOF-Utilization-Costs/scripts/build_real_panel.py`

## 3. Sample Size Distribution
The current Aim 2 panel (2010-2019) includes 486 participants. Frailty data from baseline is distributed as follows:

| Frailty Category | N (Persons) | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Robust** | 6 | **Extremely small sample size** |
| **Pre-frail** | 71 | |
| **Frail** | 49 | |
| **Unknown** | 360 | No frailty assessment data in K15 |

**Total matched with frailty: 126**

## 4. Model Diagnostics & Risks
Initial models were fitted using the interaction term `FOF_status * frailty_fried`.

### 4.1 Statistical Instability
- **Non-Convergence / Singularities**: Due to the N=6 count in the "Robust" reference group, the model coefficients for the intercept and the main effects of frailty categories show extremely large standard errors ($2.96 \times 10^5$), indicating statistical instability.
- **Interpretation Risk**: The current interaction estimates (Rate Ratios and Cost Ratios) are unreliable. The bootstrap intervals for the aggregated effect (`panel_models_summary.csv`) appear narrow only because the interaction term is being "neutralized" by the large standard errors, or the model is defaulting to a mean-only estimation for sparse cells.

### 4.2 Visualization
- **Trend Plot**: `trend_visits_by_frailty.png` shows the raw utilization rates per person-year stratified by the three known frailty categories.
- **Observations**: The "Robust" group (N=6) shows high volatility in the trend due to individual-level outliers significantly impacting the group mean.

## 5. Questions for Clinical/Statistical Expert
1. **Grouping Strategy**: Given N=6 for Robust, do you recommend merging the **Robust** and **Pre-frail** groups into a single reference category (e.g., "Non-Frail") for the interaction models?
2. **Missingness Bias**: Is the "Unknown" group (N=360) systematically different from those assessed for frailty? If so, should we include an "Unknown" category in the model rather than excluding them?
3. **Model Specification**: Should we move from an interaction model to a stratified model if the goal is to show the effect of FOF *within* frailty strata, considering the sparse reference cell?

## 6. Next Steps
- [ ] Implement group merging (Robust + Pre-frail) pending expert feedback.
- [ ] Move `R/45_visualize_aim2_outputs.R` into the main execution pipeline.
- [ ] Re-run models with stratified approach if requested.
