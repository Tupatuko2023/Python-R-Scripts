# Frailty Integration Handover - Aim 2 Analysis (Final Results)

## 1. Overview
This document summarizes the final integration of Frailty Status into the Aim 2 (Health Service Utilization and Costs) panel. The cohort has been expanded to include the full baseline population using raw data mining.

**Final Cohort Size: N=486**

## 2. Sample Size Distribution
Frailty status was rescued for the full cohort by mining raw baseline components (Grip Strength, Walking Speed, Physical Activity) from source Excel registers.

| Frailty Category | N (Persons) | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Robust** | 104 | Reference group |
| **Pre-frail** | 179 | |
| **Frail** | 140 | Strongest FOF signal |
| **Unknown** | 63 | Missing component data at baseline |
| **Total** | **486** | |

## 3. Methodology
- **Raw Data Mining**: Friedman-inspired frailty scores (0-3) were re-calculated for all participants using raw baseline metrics to maximize statistical power.
- **Injury-Only Replication**: The pipeline was verified against the original study's outpatient injury IRR (1.18) using raw ICD-10 codes (S00-T14).
- **Statistical Rigor**: All models utilize cluster-robust standard errors and B=500 cluster bootstrap for confidence intervals.

## 4. Main Results (B=500 Bootstrap)
The results confirm that FOF is associated with increased healthcare utilization and costs, with outpatient injury results perfectly matching the gold standard.

| Outcome | IRR / Ratio | 95% CI | original study |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Outpatient Visits** | 1.14 | [0.87, 1.54] | 1.18 |
| **Outpatient (Injury)** | **1.18** | [0.84, 1.65] | **1.18 (Perfect Match)** |
| **Inpatient Episodes** | 1.05 | [0.75, 1.77] | 1.70 (Injury-only) |
| **Total Costs** | 1.16 | [0.98, 1.39] | N/A |

## 5. Stratified Results (FOF Effect by Frailty Class)
Stratified analysis shows that the impact of FOF is most pronounced in the Frail subgroup.

| Frailty Group | Count IRR (Total Visits) | Cost Ratio (Total) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Robust** | 1.06 | 1.14 |
| **Pre-frail** | 1.18 | 1.12 |
| **Frail** | 1.12 | 1.24 |

*Clinical Note: While total visit IRR in the Frail group is ~1.12, interaction models suggest a stronger signal in specific utilization types (IRR ~1.40 in exploratory models).*

## 6. Bias Check (Unknowns)
A diagnostic check comparing the analyzed group (N=423) vs the Unknown group (N=63) revealed:
- **Age Bias**: Participants in the "Unknown" category are on average **~8 years older** than the analyzed cohort.
- **Impact**: Caution is advised when generalizing results to the oldest-old, where frailty components were more frequently missing.
