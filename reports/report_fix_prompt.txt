Report: fix_prompt.txt Task

Objective
- Review and harden fof-preflight and fof-qc-summarizer skills against FOF conventions.
- Reduce false pass/false fail risk for Required vars parsing, output discipline checks, and privacy guardrails.
- Keep changes minimal and fail-closed when rules cannot be verified.

Key changes
- fof-preflight: Required vars parsing handles comma-separated and bullet-per-line forms; ambiguous lines fail closed.
- fof-preflight: Required vars vs req_cols comparison is now order-sensitive and 1:1.
- fof-preflight: outputs/ heuristic accepts outputs_dir/init_paths usage; otherwise fails with explicit reason.
- fof-qc-summarizer: skip_name uses safer word-boundary patterns (no substring "id" overreach).
- fof-qc-summarizer: init.R discovered dynamically by scanning for manifest helpers.
- fof-qc-summarizer: manifest header mismatch now reports observed header and fails closed.
- fof-qc-summarizer: script label configurable via --script-label.
- Documentation: fof-qc-summarizer SKILL.md notes dynamic init.R discovery.

Files touched
- .codex/skills/fof-preflight/scripts/preflight.py
- .codex/skills/fof-qc-summarizer/scripts/qc_summarize.R
- .codex/skills/fof-qc-summarizer/SKILL.md

Smoke tests (no data)
- python .codex/skills/fof-preflight/scripts/preflight.py --help
- python .codex/skills/fof-preflight/scripts/preflight.py
- Rscript .codex/skills/fof-qc-summarizer/scripts/qc_summarize.R --help
- Rscript .codex/skills/fof-qc-summarizer/scripts/qc_summarize.R  (expected fail if QC outputs missing)

Privacy guard (synthetic)
- Run qc_summarize.R against a temp qc_dir containing a file with id column to ensure it is skipped and no id values are printed.

Notes
- All changes are fail-closed and do not touch data or QC inputs.
- Manifest writing only proceeds after header validation and helper discovery.
