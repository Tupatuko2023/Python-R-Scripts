Report: Cfix_prompt.txt Task

Objective
- Validate hardened skills with no-data and (if available) QC-data tests.
- Confirm preflight fail-closed behavior for guardrails.
- Confirm qc-summarizer aggregates only and logs manifest correctly.

What was tested
- preflight --help: OK (exit 0).
- preflight on current diff: PASS (no changes).
- Negative test (Required vars mismatch): FAIL as expected.
- Negative test (Required vars header missing): FAIL as expected.
- QC outputs presence check: missing (qc_dir not found).
- qc_summarize tests: blocked (Rscript not available in environment).

Results
- preflight behavior is fail-closed for Required vars violations.
- Output-discipline parsing hardened to avoid false failures on comment separators.
- QC summarizer tests and manifest append verification are pending due to missing Rscript and QC outputs.

Blockers / gaps
- Rscript not installed in current environment.
- QC outputs directory missing (K18 QC not run here).
- data/ guardrail negative test requires modifying a tracked file; not executed here.

Commands to reproduce (from Fear-of-Falling)
- python ../.codex/skills/fof-preflight/scripts/preflight.py --help
- python ../.codex/skills/fof-preflight/scripts/preflight.py
- Rscript ../.codex/skills/fof-qc-summarizer/scripts/qc_summarize.R --help
- Rscript ../.codex/skills/fof-qc-summarizer/scripts/qc_summarize.R
- test -d R-scripts/K18/outputs/K18_QC/qc && echo qc_dir_exists || echo qc_dir_missing

Notes
- No data or QC inputs were modified.
- Once Rscript + QC outputs are available, run qc_summarize and verify qc_summary.* and manifest rows.
