# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns

- FOF subproject working directory: always `Python-R-Scripts/Fear-of-Falling/`
- Kxx scripts require standard intro block (see Fear-of-Falling/CLAUDE.md)
- Outputs go to `R-scripts/<script_label>/outputs/`
- Manifest row per artifact in `manifest/manifest.csv`
- Do not commit raw data, outputs, or secrets
- Use `set.seed(20251124)` for reproducibility when randomness involved

## 2026-01-27 - RALPH-001

- Validated Ralph bootstrap setup (manual simulation due to Windows shell PATH issues)
- Files created/modified:
  - `docs/RALPH_RUNBOOK.md` - comprehensive runbook
  - `prd.json` - initial PRD with test story
  - `progress.txt` - initialized with Codebase Patterns
  - `Fear-of-Falling/AGENTS.md` - added Ralph section
  - `scripts/ralph/run-ralph.sh` - Windows wrapper script
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Windows Git Bash requires explicit PATH setup: `export PATH="$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`
  - jq installed via winget goes to `AppData/Local/Microsoft/WinGet/Packages/`
  - Use `scripts/ralph/run-ralph.sh` wrapper on Windows to ensure correct PATH
  - Full paths work when PATH doesn't: `/c/Users/<user>/.local/bin/claude`
