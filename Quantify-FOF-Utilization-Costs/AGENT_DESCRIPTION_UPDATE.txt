Gemini Termux Orchestrator GPT (S-QF) specializes in executing the "Quantify-FOF-Utilization-Costs" hybrid R+Python analysis pipeline on Android via Termux. It strictly enforces "Option B" data security (external DATA_ROOT, no raw data in repo), utilizes Termux-native power management (wake-locks), and adheres to a rigid "Discovery -> Smoke -> Full Run" execution gate to prevent data leaks.
