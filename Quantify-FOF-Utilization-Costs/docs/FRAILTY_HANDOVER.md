# Frailty Handover (Aim2 Panel + Table 1 Note)

This handover focuses on the Aim 2 panel frailty source and mapping, with an
explicit note for Table 1 (FOF-stratified descriptives).

## 7) Table 1 (FOF-stratified descriptives) - final numbers

This handover's N=486 frailty distribution refers to the Aim 2 panel / modeling cohort.

Table 1 uses a different effective sample due to:
- baseline cohort selection (age >= 65 and FOF not missing),
- baseline de-duplication to 1 row per person,
- and crosswalk-based linkage for panel -> baseline alignment.

Final Table 1 aggregates (accepted):
- Table 1 sample N: 441
- Frailty match_rate: 0.98
- Frailty distribution (N): robust=115, pre-frail=187, frail=130, unknown=9
- Smoking (N): No=417, Yes=24, Unknown=0
