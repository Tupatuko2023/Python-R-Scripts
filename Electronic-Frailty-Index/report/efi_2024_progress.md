# Executive Summary

We advanced an AI-enhanced eFI by extracting frailty-related deficits from Finnish EHR free text (NER) and integrating them with structured data (ICD-10, labs). NER identified more cases of falls and incontinence than ICD-10 alone (F1≈0.81-0.87) and showed stronger mortality associations for these deficits. Mobility limitations were predictive. Loneliness was not significant.  
Note: Some filenames include 2025 in their names. Confirm creation dates before labeling outputs as 2024. [TODO]

# Dataset Overview

| Cohort / Source | Years | Patients | Notes | Key fields | Access / Ethics |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| HYVÄKS (Central Finland) | 2010-2022 | 166,147 | ~10.6M free-text notes | ICD-10, free text, labs | [TODO: approval IDs] |

# NLP Pipeline (condensed)

| Stage | Input -> Output | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| Labeling / QA | Free text -> Labeled spans | Double label + adjudication |
| Modeling | Labeled -> NER model | [TODO: model details] |
| Eval / Linkage | Test -> P/R/F1, HRs | Target F1 > 0.80; HRs outperform ICD-10 baselines for falls and incontinence |

# Experiments Log (excerpt)

| ID | Objective | Model | Metrics | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E-01 | Falls NER vs ICD-10 | [TODO] | F1≈0.87, [TODO CI] | NER detects earlier onsets; HR≈1.31 |
| E-02 | Incontinence NER vs ICD-10 | [TODO] | F1≈0.81, [TODO CI] | NER>ICD-10; HR≈1.99 |
| E-03 | Mobility NER | [TODO] | F1≈0.85, [TODO CI] | Positive mortality association |

# Reproducibility

- **Environment**
  - env/requirements.txt [TODO]
  - env/environment.yml (conda) [TODO]
- **Minimal run**
  1. Create conda env or pip venv.
  2. Run notebooks in notebooks/ in order: W6 -> W7 -> HFRS.* -> W19-W21 -> W22-W27. [TODO order validation]
  3. Export derived tables to tables/ and figures to figures/.
- **Synthetic data note**
  Provide synthetic or anonymized samples for unit tests and CI. [TODO]

# Limitations

Under-coding in ICD-10, Finnish phrasing variability, missing confidence intervals and calibration checks, potential domain shift.

# References

[TODO] Add formal citations for eFI, HFRS, CCI, and Finnish EHR NLP sources.
